<h1>Simulation of Electromagnetic wave interacton with FDTD computational method and designing Huygens' metasurfaces.</h1>
FDTD python module updates are uploaded here along with the scripts I used for designing and analysing.<br/>
Saved simulations are stored at https://mega.nz/folder/E6YW1BzQ#dpeNsYn4uJT6ZCZbhpDUZA.<br/><br/>
This is a part of my final year project for my Masters degree.
