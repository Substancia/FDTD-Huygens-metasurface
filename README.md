Simulation of Electromagnetic wave interacton with FDTD computational method and designing Huygens' metasurfaces.
FDTD python module updates are uploaded here along with the scripts I used for designing and analysing.
Saved simulations are stored at https://mega.nz/folder/E6YW1BzQ#dpeNsYn4uJT6ZCZbhpDUZA.
This is a part of my final year project for my Masters degree.
